    "text": "This is an easy one. In the GitHub folder for this puzzle, I have uploaded a histogram of 1e6 values of the determinants which indicates the distribution of the determinant and it is pretty evident that the mean is 0.\nThe answer is a very general one, infact any nxn matrix whose each element is i.i.d. random variables, then the determinant has expected value 0. I present two approaches to theoretically arrive at the answer.\n\nConsider an \\(n \\times n\\) random matrix \\[\nA = [a_{i,j}]\n\\] whose entries are i.i.d. random variables drawn from some distribution with finite mean and variance. Denote \\[\n\\mu = \\mathbb{E}[a_{i,j}]\n\\] for any \\((i,j)\\).\n\n\nMathematical Argument (Leibniz Expansion)\nFrom the Leibniz formula, the determinant can be written as \\[\n\\det(A) = \\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_n} \\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma)\n\\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i, \\sigma(i)},\n\\] where \\(S_n\\) is the symmetric group on \\(n\\) elements, and \\(\\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma)\\) is the signature of permutation \\(\\sigma\\).\nTaking expectations: \\[\n\\mathbb{E}[\\det(A)] =\n\\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_n} \\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma)\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\n\\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,\\sigma(i)}\n\\right].\n\\] Since the entries are i.i.d., their expectations factorize: \\[\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\n\\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,\\sigma(i)}\n\\right]\n= \\prod_{i=1}^n \\mathbb{E}[a_{i,\\sigma(i)}]\n= \\mu^n.\n\\] Hence \\[\n\\mathbb{E}[\\det(A)] = \\mu^n\n\\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_n} \\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma).\n\\] But \\[\n\\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_n} \\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma) = 0\n\\] since exactly half of the permutations are even and half are odd. Therefore \\[\n\\boxed{\n\\mathbb{E}[\\det(A)] = 0\n}.\n\\]\n\n\n\nSymmetry Argument (Row Exchange Invariance)\nAlternatively, note that the rows of \\(A\\) are i.i.d., so their joint distribution is exchangeable — any permutation of the rows leaves the distribution of \\(A\\) unchanged.\nHowever, the determinant is an alternating function of its rows: permuting two rows flips the sign of the determinant. That means for any random matrix \\[\n\\det(A) \\overset{d}{=} -\\det(A)\n\\] by randomly permuting two rows.\nTaking expectations on both sides gives \\[\n\\mathbb{E}[\\det(A)] = \\mathbb{E}[-\\det(A)] = -\\mathbb{E}[\\det(A)].\n\\] This forces \\[\n\\boxed{\n\\mathbb{E}[\\det(A)] = 0\n}.\n\\]"

    "text": "When you change direction, for example if you were initially moving right, you then switch to moving up (and vice versa).\nHowever, if you change direction twice, you end up facing the same direction you started with.\nTherefore, after an odd number of direction changes, you will be facing a different direction from the one you began with.\n\nLet us place the \\(n \\times n\\) lattice in the positive quadrant of the \\(xy\\)-plane, with lattice points labeled \\((0,0), (0,1), (1,0), \\dots, (n,n)\\).\n\nIf your first step is rightwards, i.e. from \\((0,0)\\) to \\((1,0)\\), then after an odd number of direction changes, your final step must be upwards, going from \\((n,n-1)\\) to \\((n,n)\\).\nSimilarly, if your first step is upwards, i.e. from \\((0,0)\\) to \\((0,1)\\), then after an odd number of direction changes your final step must be rightwards, going from \\((n-1,n)\\) to \\((n,n)\\).\n\nSo the total number of paths with an odd number of direction changes is the sum of:\n\nthe number of paths from \\((1,0)\\) to \\((n,n-1)\\), and\n\nthe number of paths from \\((0,1)\\) to \\((n-1,n)\\).\n\nEach of these counts is \\(\\binom{2n-2}{n-1}\\), so their total is \\[\n2 \\times \\binom{2n-2}{n-1}.\n\\]\nThe total number of possible paths across the entire lattice is \\[\n\\binom{2n}{n}.\n\\]\nHence, the required probability of picking a random path with an odd number of direction changes is \\[\n\\boxed{\n\\frac{2 \\binom{2n-2}{n-1}}{\\binom{2n}{n}} = \\frac{n}{2n - 1}\n}.\n\\]"
