    "text": "This is an easy one. In the GitHub folder for this puzzle, I have uploaded a histogram of 1e6 values of the determinants which indicates the distribution of the determinant and it is pretty evident that the mean is 0.\nThe answer is a very general one, infact any nxn matrix whose each element is i.i.d. random variables, then the determinant has expected value 0. I present two approaches to theoretically arrive at the answer.\n\nConsider an \\(n \\times n\\) random matrix \\[\nA = [a_{i,j}]\n\\] whose entries are i.i.d. random variables drawn from some distribution with finite mean and variance. Denote \\[\n\\mu = \\mathbb{E}[a_{i,j}]\n\\] for any \\((i,j)\\).\n\n\nMathematical Argument (Leibniz Expansion)\nFrom the Leibniz formula, the determinant can be written as \\[\n\\det(A) = \\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_n} \\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma)\n\\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i, \\sigma(i)},\n\\] where \\(S_n\\) is the symmetric group on \\(n\\) elements, and \\(\\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma)\\) is the signature of permutation \\(\\sigma\\).\nTaking expectations: \\[\n\\mathbb{E}[\\det(A)] =\n\\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_n} \\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma)\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\n\\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,\\sigma(i)}\n\\right].\n\\] Since the entries are i.i.d., their expectations factorize: \\[\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\n\\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,\\sigma(i)}\n\\right]\n= \\prod_{i=1}^n \\mathbb{E}[a_{i,\\sigma(i)}]\n= \\mu^n.\n\\] Hence \\[\n\\mathbb{E}[\\det(A)] = \\mu^n\n\\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_n} \\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma).\n\\] But \\[\n\\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_n} \\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma) = 0\n\\] since exactly half of the permutations are even and half are odd. Therefore \\[\n\\boxed{\n\\mathbb{E}[\\det(A)] = 0\n}.\n\\]\n\n\n\nSymmetry Argument (Row Exchange Invariance)\nAlternatively, note that the rows of \\(A\\) are i.i.d., so their joint distribution is exchangeable â€” any permutation of the rows leaves the distribution of \\(A\\) unchanged.\nHowever, the determinant is an alternating function of its rows: permuting two rows flips the sign of the determinant. That means for any random matrix \\[\n\\det(A) \\overset{d}{=} -\\det(A)\n\\] by randomly permuting two rows.\nTaking expectations on both sides gives \\[\n\\mathbb{E}[\\det(A)] = \\mathbb{E}[-\\det(A)] = -\\mathbb{E}[\\det(A)].\n\\] This forces \\[\n\\boxed{\n\\mathbb{E}[\\det(A)] = 0\n}.\n\\]"
