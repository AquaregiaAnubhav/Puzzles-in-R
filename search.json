    "text": "When you change direction, for example if you were initially moving right, you then switch to moving up (and vice versa).\nHowever, if you change direction twice, you end up facing the same direction you started with.\nTherefore, after an odd number of direction changes, you will be facing a different direction from the one you began with.\n\nLet us place the \\(n \\times n\\) lattice in the positive quadrant of the \\(xy\\)-plane, with lattice points labeled \\((0,0), (0,1), (1,0), \\dots, (n,n)\\).\n\nIf your first step is rightwards, i.e. from \\((0,0)\\) to \\((1,0)\\), then after an odd number of direction changes, your final step must be upwards, going from \\((n,n-1)\\) to \\((n,n)\\).\nSimilarly, if your first step is upwards, i.e. from \\((0,0)\\) to \\((0,1)\\), then after an odd number of direction changes your final step must be rightwards, going from \\((n-1,n)\\) to \\((n,n)\\).\n\nSo the total number of paths with an odd number of direction changes is the sum of:\n\nthe number of paths from \\((1,0)\\) to \\((n,n-1)\\), and\n\nthe number of paths from \\((0,1)\\) to \\((n-1,n)\\).\n\nEach of these counts is \\(\\binom{2n-2}{n-1}\\), so their total is \\[\n2 \\times \\binom{2n-2}{n-1}.\n\\]\nThe total number of possible paths across the entire lattice is \\[\n\\binom{2n}{n}.\n\\]\nHence, the required probability of picking a random path with an odd number of direction changes is \\[\n\\boxed{\n\\frac{2 \\binom{2n-2}{n-1}}{\\binom{2n}{n}} = \\frac{n}{2n - 1}\n}.\n\\]"

    "text": "This is an easy one. In the GitHub folder for this puzzle, I have uploaded a histogram of 1e6 values of the determinants which indicates the distribution of the determinant and it is pretty evident that the mean is 0.\nThe answer is a very general one, infact any nxn matrix whose each element is i.i.d. random variables, then the determinant has expected value 0. I present two approaches to theoretically arrive at the answer.\n\nConsider an \\(n \\times n\\) random matrix \\[\nA = [a_{i,j}]\n\\] whose entries are i.i.d. random variables drawn from some distribution with finite mean and variance. Denote \\[\n\\mu = \\mathbb{E}[a_{i,j}]\n\\] for any \\((i,j)\\).\n\n\nMathematical Argument (Leibniz Expansion)\nFrom the Leibniz formula, the determinant can be written as \\[\n\\det(A) = \\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_n} \\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma)\n\\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i, \\sigma(i)},\n\\] where \\(S_n\\) is the symmetric group on \\(n\\) elements, and \\(\\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma)\\) is the signature of permutation \\(\\sigma\\).\nTaking expectations: \\[\n\\mathbb{E}[\\det(A)] =\n\\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_n} \\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma)\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\n\\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,\\sigma(i)}\n\\right].\n\\] Since the entries are i.i.d., their expectations factorize: \\[\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\n\\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,\\sigma(i)}\n\\right]\n= \\prod_{i=1}^n \\mathbb{E}[a_{i,\\sigma(i)}]\n= \\mu^n.\n\\] Hence \\[\n\\mathbb{E}[\\det(A)] = \\mu^n\n\\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_n} \\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma).\n\\] But \\[\n\\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_n} \\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma) = 0\n\\] since exactly half of the permutations are even and half are odd. Therefore \\[\n\\boxed{\n\\mathbb{E}[\\det(A)] = 0\n}.\n\\]\n\n\n\nSymmetry Argument (Row Exchange Invariance)\nAlternatively, note that the rows of \\(A\\) are i.i.d., so their joint distribution is exchangeable — any permutation of the rows leaves the distribution of \\(A\\) unchanged.\nHowever, the determinant is an alternating function of its rows: permuting two rows flips the sign of the determinant. That means for any random matrix \\[\n\\det(A) \\overset{d}{=} -\\det(A)\n\\] by randomly permuting two rows.\nTaking expectations on both sides gives \\[\n\\mathbb{E}[\\det(A)] = \\mathbb{E}[-\\det(A)] = -\\mathbb{E}[\\det(A)].\n\\] This forces \\[\n\\boxed{\n\\mathbb{E}[\\det(A)] = 0\n}.\n\\]"

    "text": "Problem Statement\nYou have an 8×8 board. On each cell you place a black or white marble, independently and uniformly at random. What is the probability that every row and every column contains an even number of white marbles?\n\n\n\nDiagram & Regions\nBelow is the board partitioned into four regions:\n\nGreen region: the top 7×7 sub-board\n\nBlue region: the 1×7 strip on the right of the top 7 rows\n\nRed region: the 1×7 strip at the bottom\n\nThe last left bottom corner cell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Insight\n\nGreen block parity\nFix all 49 cells of the green 7×7 block arbitrarily. For each row (i=1,,7), let\n\\[p_i = \\sum_{j=1}^7 \\text{green}(i,j) \\bmod 2,\\]\nand for each column (j=1,,7), let\n\\[q_j = \\sum_{i=1}^7 \\text{green}(i,j) \\bmod 2.\\]\nEach (p_i,q_j{0,1}) indicates odd (1) or even (0) parity in that row or column of the green region.\nBlue strip correction\nTo correct row (i) parity, set the blue cell at ((i,8)) to (p_i). Since toggling by 1 flips parity, this uniquely enforces evenness: \\[\n  \\text{blue}(i,8) = p_i,\n  \\quad i=1,\\dots,7.\n\\]\nRed strip correction\nAfter placing the blues, each column (j=1,,7) still has parity (q_j). To enforce evenness there, set: \\[\n  \\text{red}(8,j) = q_j,\n  \\quad j=1,\\dots,7.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nParity Consistency and the Last Cell\nBefore choosing ((8,8)):\n\nRow 8 parity is\n\\[r_8 = \\sum_{j=1}^7 \\text{red}(8,j) \\bmod 2 = \\sum_{j=1}^7 q_j \\bmod 2.\\]\nColumn 8 parity is\n\\[c_8 = \\sum_{i=1}^7 \\text{blue}(i,8) \\bmod 2 = \\sum_{i=1}^7 p_i \\bmod 2.\\]\n\nBy exchanging sums, \\[\n  \\sum_{i=1}^7 p_i\n  = \\sum_{i=1}^7 \\sum_{j=1}^7 \\text{green}(i,j) \\bmod 2\n  = \\sum_{j=1}^7 \\sum_{i=1}^7 \\text{green}(i,j) \\bmod 2\n  = \\sum_{j=1}^7 q_j.\n\\]\nHence (r_8 = c_8). A single choice of ((8,8)), \\[\n  \\text{cell}(8,8) = r_8 = c_8,\n\\] simultaneously fixes both final parities to even.\n\n\n\nCounting & Final Probability\n\nGreen block: (2^{49}) arbitrary patterns.\n\nBlue strip: forced choices ((^7)).\n\nRed strip: forced choices ((^7)).\n\nLast cell: forced (()).\n\nTotal valid boards: (2^{49}). Of the (2^{64}) total,\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{2^{49}}{2^{64}} = 2^{-15} \\approx 3.05\\times10^{-5}.\n\\]\n\n\n\nWhy Worry About Blue & Red Parities?\n\nRows first, columns second is not symmetrical, so one might fear the two parity-fixing operations could clash.\n\nThe “swap-the-sum” identity guarantees they never clash: correcting rows with the blue strip automatically makes the total column parity defect equal to the total row parity defect, so a single marble can finish the job.\n\nIn linear-algebra terms, the 8 row parities + 8 column parities give 16 constraints, but only 15 are independent. Once 15 are satisfied, the last follows automatically—this is why the lone corner cell can resolve both at once.\n\n\n\nFinal Answer\nProbability that every row and column has an even number of white marbles:\n\\[\n2^{-15}.\n\\]"
