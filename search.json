    "text": "When you change direction, for example if you were initially moving right, you then switch to moving up (and vice versa).\nHowever, if you change direction twice, you end up facing the same direction you started with.\nTherefore, after an odd number of direction changes, you will be facing a different direction from the one you began with.\n\nLet us place the \\(n \\times n\\) lattice in the positive quadrant of the \\(xy\\)-plane, with lattice points labeled \\((0,0), (0,1), (1,0), \\dots, (n,n)\\).\n\nIf your first step is rightwards, i.e. from \\((0,0)\\) to \\((1,0)\\), then after an odd number of direction changes, your final step must be upwards, going from \\((n,n-1)\\) to \\((n,n)\\).\nSimilarly, if your first step is upwards, i.e. from \\((0,0)\\) to \\((0,1)\\), then after an odd number of direction changes your final step must be rightwards, going from \\((n-1,n)\\) to \\((n,n)\\).\n\nSo the total number of paths with an odd number of direction changes is the sum of:\n\nthe number of paths from \\((1,0)\\) to \\((n,n-1)\\), and\n\nthe number of paths from \\((0,1)\\) to \\((n-1,n)\\).\n\nEach of these counts is \\(\\binom{2n-2}{n-1}\\), so their total is \\[\n2 \\times \\binom{2n-2}{n-1}.\n\\]\nThe total number of possible paths across the entire lattice is \\[\n\\binom{2n}{n}.\n\\]\nHence, the required probability of picking a random path with an odd number of direction changes is \\[\n\\boxed{\n\\frac{2 \\binom{2n-2}{n-1}}{\\binom{2n}{n}} = \\frac{n}{2n - 1}\n}.\n\\]"
