# Expected Square of the Area of a Random Triangle on 5 × 5‑Lattice 

Choose three lattice points  
$
(x_1,y_1),\;(x_2,y_2),\;(x_3,y_3)\in \{0,1,2,3,4\}^2
$
**independently and uniformly at random.**

**Question:**  
Let $A$ be the area of the triangle determined by those three points.  
What is the expected value of $A^{2}$?
