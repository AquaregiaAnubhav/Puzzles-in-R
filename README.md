# Puzzles-in-R
This GitHub repo hosts R solutions for mathematical puzzles. Each folder includes two .md files containing a problem statement, a solution explaining file, and an R file that contains three approaches in one place: a brute-force or semi-brute-force implementation, a version of my code optimized by ChatGPT(commented out), and a theoretical (formula-based) solution(commented out).
