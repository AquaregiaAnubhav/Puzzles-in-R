# Problem Statement

You have an **8×8** board. On each cell you place a black or white marble, independently and uniformly at random. What is the probability that **every row** and **every column** contains an **even** number of white marbles?

---

# Diagram & Regions

Below is the board partitioned into four regions:

- **Green region**: the top 7×7 sub-board  
- **Blue region**: the 1×7 strip on the right of the top 7 rows  
- **Red region**: the 1×7 strip at the bottom  
- The last left bottom corner cell

# Key Insight

1. **Green block parity**  
   Fix all 49 cells of the green 7×7 block arbitrarily. For each row \(i=1,\dots,7\), let  
   $$p_i = \sum_{j=1}^7 \text{green}(i,j) \bmod 2,$$  
   and for each column \(j=1,\dots,7\), let  
   $$q_j = \sum_{i=1}^7 \text{green}(i,j) \bmod 2.$$  
   Each \(p_i,q_j\in\{0,1\}\) indicates odd (1) or even (0) parity in that row or column of the green region.

2. **Blue strip correction**  
   To correct row \(i\) parity, set the blue cell at \((i,8)\) to \(p_i\). Since toggling by 1 flips parity, this uniquely enforces evenness:
   $$
     \text{blue}(i,8) = p_i,
     \quad i=1,\dots,7.
   $$

3. **Red strip correction**  
   After placing the blues, each column \(j=1,\dots,7\) still has parity \(q_j\). To enforce evenness there, set:
   $$
     \text{red}(8,j) = q_j,
     \quad j=1,\dots,7.
   $$

# Parity Consistency and the Last Cell

Before choosing \((8,8)\):

- **Row 8 parity** is  
  $$r_8 = \sum_{j=1}^7 \text{red}(8,j) \bmod 2 = \sum_{j=1}^7 q_j \bmod 2.$$
- **Column 8 parity** is  
  $$c_8 = \sum_{i=1}^7 \text{blue}(i,8) \bmod 2 = \sum_{i=1}^7 p_i \bmod 2.$$

By exchanging sums,
$$
  \sum_{i=1}^7 p_i
  = \sum_{i=1}^7 \sum_{j=1}^7 \text{green}(i,j) \bmod 2
  = \sum_{j=1}^7 \sum_{i=1}^7 \text{green}(i,j) \bmod 2
  = \sum_{j=1}^7 q_j.
$$

Hence \(r_8 = c_8\). A single choice of \((8,8)\),
$$
  \text{cell}(8,8) = r_8 = c_8,
$$
simultaneously fixes both final parities to even.

# Counting & Final Probability

- **Green block**: \(2^{49}\) arbitrary patterns.  
- **Blue strip**: forced choices (\(\times1^7\)).  
- **Red strip**: forced choices (\(\times1^7\)).  
- **Last cell**: forced (\(\times1\)).  

Total valid boards: \(2^{49}\). Of the \(2^{64}\) total,  
$$
\text{Probability} = \frac{2^{49}}{2^{64}} = 2^{-15} \approx 3.05\times10^{-5}.
$$

# Why Worry About Blue & Red Parities?

- **Rows first, columns second** is *not* symmetrical, so one might fear the two parity-fixing operations could clash.  
- The “swap-the-sum” identity guarantees they never clash: correcting rows with the blue strip automatically makes the *total* column parity defect equal to the *total* row parity defect, so a *single* marble can finish the job.

In linear-algebra terms, the 8 row parities + 8 column parities give 16 constraints, but only 15 are independent.  Once 15 are satisfied, the last follows automatically—this is why the lone corner cell can resolve both at once.

# Final Answer

**Probability** that every row and column has an even number of white marbles:  
$$
2^{-15}.
$$
