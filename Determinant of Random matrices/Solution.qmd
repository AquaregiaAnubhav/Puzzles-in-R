This is an easy one. In the GitHub folder for this puzzle, I have uploaded a histogram of 1e6 values of the determinants which indicates the distribution of the determinant and it is pretty evident that the mean is 0.

The answer is a very general one, infact any nxn matrix whose each element is i.i.d. random variables, then the determinant has expected value 0. I present two approaches to theoretically arrive at the answer.

Consider an $n \times n$ random matrix
$$
A = [a_{i,j}]
$$
whose entries are i.i.d. random variables drawn from some distribution with finite mean and variance. Denote
$$
\mu = \mathbb{E}[a_{i,j}]
$$
for any $(i,j)$.

### Mathematical Argument (Leibniz Expansion)

From the Leibniz formula, the determinant can be written as
$$
\det(A) = \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)
\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i, \sigma(i)},
$$
where $S_n$  is the symmetric group on $n$ elements, and $\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)$ is the signature of permutation $\sigma$.

Taking expectations:
$$
\mathbb{E}[\det(A)] =
\sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)
\mathbb{E}\left[
\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,\sigma(i)}
\right].
$$
Since the entries are i.i.d., their expectations factorize:
$$
\mathbb{E}\left[
\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i,\sigma(i)}
\right]
= \prod_{i=1}^n \mathbb{E}[a_{i,\sigma(i)}]
= \mu^n.
$$
Hence
$$
\mathbb{E}[\det(A)] = \mu^n
\sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \operatorname{sgn}(\sigma).
$$
But
$$
\sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \operatorname{sgn}(\sigma) = 0
$$
since exactly half of the permutations are even and half are odd. Therefore
$$
\boxed{
\mathbb{E}[\det(A)] = 0
}.
$$

### Symmetry Argument (Row Exchange Invariance)

Alternatively, note that the rows of $A$ are i.i.d., so their joint distribution is *exchangeable* â€” any permutation of the rows leaves the distribution of $A$ unchanged.

However, the determinant is an *alternating* function of its rows: permuting two rows flips the sign of the determinant. That means for any random matrix
$$
\det(A) \overset{d}{=} -\det(A)
$$
by randomly permuting two rows.

Taking expectations on both sides gives
$$
\mathbb{E}[\det(A)] = \mathbb{E}[-\det(A)] = -\mathbb{E}[\det(A)].
$$
This forces
$$
\boxed{
\mathbb{E}[\det(A)] = 0
}.
$$
