# Problem: Rolling Until the LCM Exceeds 2000

You repeatedly roll a **fair 10-sided die** whose faces are numbered 1 through 10.

* Begin with an empty list of results.  
* After each roll, compute the **least common multiple (LCM)** of *all* numbers rolled so far.  

The process **stops** the moment this running LCM becomes **strictly greater than 2000**.

---

**Puzzle:**  
What is the **expected number of rolls** required until the process stops?
