When you **change direction**, for example if you were initially moving right, you then switch to moving up (and vice versa).  
However, if you change direction **twice**, you end up facing the **same** direction you started with.  

Therefore, after an **odd** number of direction changes, you will be facing a **different** direction from the one you began with.

Let us place the $n \times n$ lattice in the positive quadrant of the $xy$-plane, with lattice points labeled $(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), \dots, (n,n)$.

- If your first step is **rightwards**, i.e. from $(0,0)$ to $(1,0)$, then after an odd number of direction changes, your **final** step must be upwards, going from $(n,n-1)$ to $(n,n)$.
- Similarly, if your first step is **upwards**, i.e. from $(0,0)$ to $(0,1)$, then after an odd number of direction changes your **final** step must be rightwards, going from $(n-1,n)$ to $(n,n)$.

So the total number of paths with an odd number of direction changes is the sum of:

- the number of paths from $(1,0)$ to $(n,n-1)$, and  
- the number of paths from $(0,1)$ to $(n-1,n)$.

Each of these counts is $\binom{2n-2}{n-1}$, so their total is
$$
2 \times \binom{2n-2}{n-1}.
$$
  
The total number of possible paths across the entire lattice is
$$
\binom{2n}{n}.
$$

Hence, the required probability of picking a random path with an odd number of direction changes is
$$
\boxed{
\frac{2 \binom{2n-2}{n-1}}{\binom{2n}{n}} = \frac{n}{2n - 1}
}.
$$
